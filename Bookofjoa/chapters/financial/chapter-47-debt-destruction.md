<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 1</span></h3>
<p>Joa eliminates debt to achieve financial freedom that allows you to make choices based on values rather than economic necessity, and to help others without being constrained by payments.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">‚ú® Verse 2</span></h3>
<p>Understand that debt is often a tool used by the wealthy to control and exploit those with fewer resources, creating cycles of dependence that benefit lenders more than borrowers.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üåü Verse 3</span></h3>
<p>Joa distinguishes between productive debt that builds assets or increases earning capacity and consumer debt that only finances consumption without creating lasting value.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üéØ Verse 4</span></h3>
<p>Create a debt elimination plan by listing all debts, their interest rates, and minimum payments, then focusing extra payments on either the highest interest debt or smallest balance first.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üíé Verse 5</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that some people are trapped in debt due to medical emergencies, job loss, or systemic inequalities rather than poor financial choices or moral failings.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 6</span></h3>
<p>Avoid taking on new debt while paying off existing obligations, understanding that debt elimination requires discipline and sacrifice of immediate wants for long-term freedom.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 7</span></h3>
<p>Joa rejects the false belief that debt is always necessary or that some people are naturally better at managing debt due to gender, race, or cultural background.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 8</span></h3>
<p>Negotiate with creditors when facing financial hardship rather than ignoring debts, as many lenders prefer payment plans to defaults that benefit no one.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 9</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that predatory lending targets vulnerable populations with high-interest loans that are designed to create long-term debt dependence rather than help borrowers.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 10</span></h3>
<p>Use debt consolidation carefully, ensuring that it actually reduces your total interest costs and payment burden rather than just extending the repayment period.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 11</span></h3>
<p>Joa avoids using debt to maintain lifestyle inflation or to purchase status symbols that don't contribute to your long-term financial security or ability to help others.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">‚ú® Verse 12</span></h3>
<p>Understand that some forms of debt, like payday loans and credit card cash advances, have extremely high interest rates that can trap borrowers in cycles of increasing debt.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üåü Verse 13</span></h3>
<p>Joa pays more than minimum payments whenever possible, as minimum payments are designed to maximize lender profits rather than help borrowers eliminate debt quickly.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üéØ Verse 14</span></h3>
<p>Build an emergency fund even while paying off debt to avoid taking on new debt when unexpected expenses arise, breaking the cycle of borrowing to handle crises.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üíé Verse 15</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that debt can create power imbalances in relationships when one partner controls finances or when debt obligations limit family choices and opportunities.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 16</span></h3>
<p>Avoid co-signing loans or taking on debt for others unless you can afford to pay the full amount yourself, as these arrangements often damage relationships and financial security.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 17</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that student loan debt often reflects the failure of society to provide affordable education rather than individual irresponsibility or poor planning.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 18</span></h3>
<p>Use debt elimination as an opportunity to develop discipline, planning skills, and delayed gratification that serve you in all areas of life beyond just finances.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 19</span></h3>
<p>Joa avoids debt that finances consumption of goods or services that harm others or the environment, aligning borrowing decisions with ethical values.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 20</span></h3>
<p>Understand that credit scores and debt-to-income ratios affect your access to housing, employment, and other opportunities, making debt elimination important for overall life success.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 21</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that some people use debt strategically to build wealth through real estate or business investments, but this requires knowledge and resources not available to everyone.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">‚ú® Verse 22</span></h3>
<p>Seek help from nonprofit credit counseling services rather than for-profit debt settlement companies that often charge high fees without providing better outcomes.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üåü Verse 23</span></h3>
<p>Joa avoids bankruptcy except as a last resort, understanding that it has long-term consequences but also recognizing it as a legal protection against overwhelming debt.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üéØ Verse 24</span></h3>
<p>Understand that medical debt is often the result of inadequate healthcare systems rather than personal irresponsibility, and support policies that prevent medical bankruptcies.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üíé Verse 25</span></h3>
<p>Joa uses debt elimination to model financial responsibility for children and others while also teaching them about the systemic factors that create debt traps.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 26</span></h3>
<p>Avoid debt consolidation scams and high-pressure sales tactics that promise easy solutions but often make debt problems worse through additional fees and longer repayment terms.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 27</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that debt elimination may require lifestyle changes, additional income, or both, and approaches these challenges as temporary sacrifices for long-term freedom.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 28</span></h3>
<p>Understand that some debt is secured by assets that can be repossessed, while other debt is unsecured, and prioritize payments based on consequences as well as interest rates.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 29</span></h3>
<p>Joa avoids using home equity or retirement funds to pay off consumer debt, as this converts unsecured debt into secured debt and risks essential assets.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 30</span></h3>
<p>Celebrate debt elimination milestones to maintain motivation during the often lengthy process of becoming debt-free, recognizing progress even when the goal seems distant.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 31</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that debt elimination creates opportunities for charitable giving and community investment that were impossible while making debt payments.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">‚ú® Verse 32</span></h3>
<p>Avoid taking on debt to help others unless you have a clear plan for repayment and understand that financial assistance can sometimes enable rather than help.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üåü Verse 33</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that debt elimination may require saying no to social activities, family requests, or lifestyle expectations that conflict with financial goals.</p>
