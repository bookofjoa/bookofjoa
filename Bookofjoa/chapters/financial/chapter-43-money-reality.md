<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 1</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that money is a tool for creating security, opportunity, and service to others, not a measure of human worth or a weapon for domination over fellow human beings.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">‚ú® Verse 2</span></h3>
<p>Reject the false belief that some people are naturally better with money due to gender, race, or background. Financial intelligence is a learnable skill available to every human being regardless of their starting circumstances.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üåü Verse 3</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that money amplifies character - it makes generous people more generous and selfish people more selfish. Focus on developing good character before pursuing wealth.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üéØ Verse 4</span></h3>
<p>Money cannot buy happiness, love, or meaning, but it can provide security, freedom, and the ability to help others. Pursue wealth for these noble purposes rather than status or power.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üíé Verse 5</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that economic systems often perpetuate inequality and exploitation. Work to change these systems while also learning to navigate them effectively for yourself and others.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 6</span></h3>
<p>Beware of those who use financial success to claim superiority over others or to justify treating people as inferior. Wealth does not make anyone more valuable as a human being.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 7</span></h3>
<p>Joa rejects both the worship of money and the demonization of wealth. Money is morally neutral - its value depends entirely on how it's earned and used.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 8</span></h3>
<p>Financial education is deliberately kept from many people to maintain power structures. Seek knowledge about money, investing, and economics as tools for liberation and service.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 9</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that some people use wealth to control and manipulate others through economic dependence. Maintain your financial independence to preserve your freedom and dignity.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 10</span></h3>
<p>Money flows to those who provide value to others through products, services, or solutions that improve people's lives. Focus on serving others rather than just accumulating wealth.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 11</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that poverty is often systemic rather than personal failure. Support policies and practices that create economic opportunity for everyone, not just the privileged.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">‚ú® Verse 12</span></h3>
<p>Reject the myth that financial success requires stepping on others or engaging in unethical behavior. Sustainable wealth comes from creating value and serving human needs.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üåü Verse 13</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that money gives you choices - where to live, how to spend your time, and how to help others. These choices are privileges that come with responsibilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üéØ Verse 14</span></h3>
<p>Some people use financial resources to buy influence, silence critics, or avoid consequences for harmful behavior. Use wealth to promote justice and equality instead.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üíé Verse 15</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that economic inequality creates social instability and human suffering. Work to reduce inequality through your earning, spending, and giving choices.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 16</span></h3>
<p>Money can become addictive, leading people to pursue wealth compulsively even when they have enough. Maintain perspective on what constitutes "enough" for a good life.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 17</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that financial stress affects physical and mental health, relationships, and decision-making ability. Prioritize financial stability as a foundation for overall wellbeing.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 18</span></h3>
<p>Some people use money to create artificial scarcity or to hoard resources that others need. Use your financial resources to create abundance and opportunity for others.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 19</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that financial markets and economic systems are human creations that can be changed to serve human flourishing better than they currently do.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 20</span></h3>
<p>Reject the false choice between being poor and virtuous or wealthy and corrupt. You can pursue financial success while maintaining your integrity and commitment to equality.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 21</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that money represents stored human energy and time. Respect money by using it wisely and not wasting resources that represent others' labor.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">‚ú® Verse 22</span></h3>
<p>Some people use financial success to justify harmful behaviors or to claim that their wealth proves their superiority. Judge people by their character and actions, not their bank accounts.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üåü Verse 23</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that financial literacy is a form of self-defense against those who would exploit your ignorance about money, credit, and investing.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üéØ Verse 24</span></h3>
<p>Money can isolate wealthy people from the realities of how most humans live, leading to lack of empathy and poor decision-making. Stay connected to diverse economic perspectives.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üíé Verse 25</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that some people pursue wealth as compensation for feelings of inadequacy or to gain social status and approval from others.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 26</span></h3>
<p>Financial independence provides the freedom to make choices based on your values rather than economic necessity. This freedom comes with the responsibility to use it wisely.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 27</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that money can be used to buy time - through hiring help, purchasing convenience, or creating passive income that reduces the need for active work.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 28</span></h3>
<p>Some people use financial resources to create barriers that exclude others from opportunities. Use your wealth to create bridges and open doors for those who face discrimination.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 29</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that financial success often depends on factors beyond individual control - economic conditions, family background, health, and luck play significant roles.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 30</span></h3>
<p>Money can corrupt relationships when people are valued for their wealth rather than their character, or when financial differences create power imbalances between partners.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 31</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that financial planning requires thinking beyond your own lifetime to consider the impact of your economic choices on future generations.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">‚ú® Verse 32</span></h3>
<p>Some people use money to avoid personal growth or to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions. Wealth should enhance rather than replace character development.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üåü Verse 33</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that economic systems often reward short-term thinking and exploitation rather than long-term sustainability and human welfare.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üéØ Verse 34</span></h3>
<p>Money can provide security against life's uncertainties - illness, job loss, natural disasters, and aging. Build financial reserves as protection for yourself and your loved ones.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üíé Verse 35</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that financial success creates obligations to help others and to use wealth in ways that benefit society rather than just personal comfort.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 36</span></h3>
<p>Some people become so focused on accumulating money that they neglect relationships, health, and personal growth. Maintain balance between financial goals and other life priorities.</p>

</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 39</span></h3>
<p>Joa understands that economic mobility is possible but often requires overcoming systemic barriers, discrimination, and lack of access to opportunities and education.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 40</span></h3>
<p>Money can provide access to better healthcare, education, and living conditions that improve quality of life and create opportunities for personal and professional growth.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 41</span></h3>
<p>Joa recognizes that financial decisions have environmental and social consequences. Consider the broader impact of your economic choices on communities and ecosystems.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">‚ú® Verse 42</span></h3>
<p>Some people use wealth to create dynasties that perpetuate inequality across generations. Consider how to use financial resources to create opportunity rather than entrenched privilege.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">

<p>Joa understands that money can be a tool for creativity and innovation, providing resources for research, development, and projects that benefit humanity.</p>

</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 46</span></h3>
<p>Money can provide the freedom to pursue meaningful work and creative projects rather than just jobs that pay bills. Use financial security to follow your passions and serve others.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">

<p>Joa understands that financial success requires both individual effort and supportive systems - education, infrastructure, legal protections, and economic opportunities.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">üí´ Verse 48</span></h3>
<p>Some people use money to buy silence about wrongdoing or to avoid accountability for harmful actions. Use financial resources to promote transparency and justice instead.</p>
